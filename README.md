## About the project

This is a simple project in which I want to show how to apply some of the best practises in order to develop a performant webapp.

The final goals of the projec are:

- [ ] Show players, teams and games stats.
- [ ] Autocomplete allowing to search by player name or surname (endpoint provided by the API) and also allowing to search by team (city or team name)*
- [ ] Add Firebase :fire: :rocket: in order to allow users to sign in, and letting them to store theirs favourite players, and making theirs *favourite five players*
- [ ] Use NGXS or NGRX in order to have global states fully controlled.

Other goals which I can classify as "improving technical knowloge" are:

- [ ] Show how to use container - presentational patterns. Using abstract classes.
- [ ] How to use [Typescript conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html).
- [ ] Jest + Cypress Testing.
- [ ] Working with [CI/CD provided by github](https://github.com/features/actions).
- [ ] Deep dive in an [interesting component library Nebular](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/).

And of course, having fun with this little project! :rocket: :smile:
